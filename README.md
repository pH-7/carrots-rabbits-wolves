# The Rabbits, Wolves, and Carrots' World

*The world is inhabited by carrots, rabbits, and wolves.*

## World Problem

Rabbits would roam this world eating car- rots that grew in random patches. When they had eaten enough carrots, the rabbits would get fat and split in two. Wolves ran around eating up the rabbits; if they managed to catch and eat enough rabbits, they would also get fat and split. Rabbits and wolves within a certain distance of each other would broadcast information on food and predators. If a rabbit found a carrot patch, other rabbits would quickly join him. If a wolf found a rabbit, the pack would start chasing it.
